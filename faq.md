# Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What is captcha.eu?
captcha.eu is an invisible bot protection service that safeguards your website forms, login screens, and user interactions without requiring users to solve puzzles or click images.

### How does it work?
Our JavaScript SDK analyzes user behavior patterns in real-time to distinguish between humans and bots. This happens invisibly in the background without interrupting the user experience.

### What is a bot? ðŸ¤–
A bot is an automated process which submits your forms or executes actions. The goal of the bot might be:
- DDoS attacks ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack))
- Enhance chances of winning (Sweepstakes)
- Manipulate data (Polls)
- Search Engines / Crawlers

The range of bot techniques varies a lot - from simple scripts to sophisticated bots that try their best to act like humans. Search Engine Bots are generally considered "good" bots.

### How do you detect bots?
We use multiple detection layers with anonymized data:
- Client-side browser classification
- Behavioral analysis: mouse movement, keyboard timings
- System timing analysis
- Machine learning to generate a likelihood-to-be-human score

### What makes captcha.eu different from other CAPTCHA services?
- **No puzzles**: No image selection or text typing required
- **GDPR compliant**: No cookies or personal data collection
- **EU hosted**: All processing happens in Austrian data centers

## Troubleshooting

### The SDK isn't loading
Check that:
1. Your domain is added in the dashboard
2. You're using the correct public key
3. The script tag is properly placed
4. Your site uses HTTPS

### Validation always fails
Common causes:
- Incorrect REST key
- Solution not sent as JSON
- Network connectivity issues
- Expired solutions (valid for 2 minutes)

See our [troubleshooting guide](troubleshoot.md) for detailed solutions.

### Getting "KROT is not defined" error
The SDK hasn't loaded yet. Wrap your code in a load event listener or use the defer attribute on the script tag.
